Question 3:
Create a Python program that simulates the roll of a six-sided die, guided by the user's choices. Here's how it
should work:
●
● Menu: Present a menu with options like "Roll Dice," "View Total Rolls," "View Roll Statistics," and "Exit."
● Roll Dice: When the user selects "Roll Dice," generate a random number between 1 and 6,
representing the die's roll. Display the result to the user.
● Track Rolls: Keep a count of the total number of rolls made throughout the program's execution.
● View Total Rolls: When the user chooses this option, display the total number of times the die has been
rolled.
● View Roll Statistics: Provide a more comprehensive breakdown of the results, showing:
○ How many times each number (1 through 6) has been rolled.
○ The percentage of times each number has appeared.
● Choose a specific number (e.g., 6) as the trigger in your code. If the die lands on the trigger
number, it explodes and rolls again immediately,
● Exit: Allow the user to gracefully exit the program when they're done rolling.
Menu:
1. Roll Dice
2. View Total Rolls
3. View Roll Statistics
4. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
You rolled a 3!
Enter your choice: 1
You rolled a 4!
Enter your choice: 1
You rolled a 6! The die explodes!
(Rolling again for explosion...)
You rolled a 4!
Enter your choice: 1
You rolled a 6! The die explodes!
(Rolling again for explosion...)
You rolled a 2!
Enter your choice: 1
You rolled a 3!
Enter your choice: 2
Total rolls made: 7
